## **Solutions**

This project contains my solutions (C++) for the problems of the Algorithms Lab class 2022-2023. The course consists in solving algorithmic problems given in a contextual description. To solve some problems, knowledge of advanced algorithms - graduate level, is required. Also, the solutions make extensive use of the BGL and CGAL libraries for C++. In each folder, one can find the code as well as the corresponding textual description.
